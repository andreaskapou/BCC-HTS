Bayesian Consensus Clustering for High Throughput Sequencing data

A Bayesian framework for performing integrative clustering based on the model proposed by Lock and Dunson (2013) in Bionformatics.

We extend this framework by incorporating additional obeervation models, such as Poisson, Binomial, Bayesian Binomial Probit Regression. This way we can facilite the analysis of HTS data, since the original model included only Gaussian distributed data.
